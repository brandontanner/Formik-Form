# Formik Form

### Description

A form consisting of text input fields for the users email and password and a submit button. The code validates the inputs, ensuring that both fields are not empty and that the email is formated as an email. When both fields meet the requirements and the user clicks the submit button, it alerts the user that the login was successful.

### How to Run

1. Download the zip file in github and navigate to the **Formik-Form-main** directory in the terminal.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. When that is complete, run `npm start`. This will load the project in the browser.
4. Enter information into the fields as stated and click **"Submit"** when finished.

### Roadmap of Future Improvements

- **Further Validation:** I plan to improve the code so that it more specifically validates the fields within the form. This would mean checking password requirements for length and special characters.
- **More Fields:** I plan to add more fields to the form including first and last name fields and a checkbox to "rememeber me" for future logins.
